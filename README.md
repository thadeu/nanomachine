üîê nanomachine is a state machine for tiny JS

# How to install

```bash
yarn add @thadeu/nanomachine
```

or

```bash
npm i @thadeu/nanomachine
```

or unpkg load script

```html
<a href="https://unpkg.com/@thadeu/nanomachine">https://unpkg.com/@thadeu/nanomachine</a>
```

# Usage

---

```js
const machine = nanomachine({
  initial: 'login',
  transitions: [
    { name: 'login', from: '*', to: 'login' },
    { name: 'waiting', from: ['login', 'unpause'], to: 'waiting' },
    { name: 'pause', from: ['waiting'], to: 'pause' },
    { name: 'unpause', from: ['pause'], to: 'waiting' },
  ],
  events: {
    login: () => null,
    waiting: () => null,
    pause: () => null,
    unpause: () => null,
  },
})
```

With a state machine started, you have access to dynamically created methods. Like for example.

If you want to leave login and go to waiting, you can use.

```js
// state is login, right?
machine.waiting()
```

Everything is based on the transition `from` to `to` was configured

```js
{ name: 'waiting', from: ['login', 'unpause'], to: 'waiting' }
```

In the case above, we say, `waiting`, you can transition from `login` or `pause` to `waiting`
Of course, it will only happen, if there is a method created in events.

The above transition must have a method to be triggered when moving, example:

```js
const machine = nanomachine({
  ......
  events: {
    waiting: () => console.log('fired waiting')
  }
  ......
})

```

The waiting event, will be invoked whenever the transition is approved in the state machine

# Conditionals

Imagine the following situation, you need to change state, only after resolving something. So!

```js
const machine = nanomachine({
  ......
  transitions: [
    { name: 'login', from: '*', to: 'login' },
    { name: 'waiting', from: ['login', 'unpause'], to: 'waiting', if: () => true | false },
  ],
  ......
})
```

or use `unless`.

```js
{ name: 'waiting', from: ['login', 'unpause'], to: 'waiting', unless: () => true }
```

# On Any Transition

You can use observers, for example

```js
const machine = nanomachine({
  ....
})

machine.on('waiting', function() {
  console.log('onWaiting')
})
```

Whenever a `waiting` transitions occurs, this observer receives a message
